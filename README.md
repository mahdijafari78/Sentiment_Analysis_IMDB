# 🎭 Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## 📌 Objective

The goal is to classify IMDB movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** based on their textual content.

## 📁 Files

- `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Transformers  Hugging Face 🤗  
- PyTorch  
- Pandas، NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Clean and preprocess the text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
3. Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
4. Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
5. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
6. Visualize results.

## 📈 Results

The trained model can predict the sentiment of a movie review with a reasonable degree of accuracy, showcasing the potential of NLP in understanding text data.
